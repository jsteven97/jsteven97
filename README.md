I'm a Drupal programmer with knowledge of JavaScript and other technologies, I understand the importance of writing well-documented and clear code in any language, and I'm familiar with Drupal's coding standards. I know how to use Drupal's JavaScript API to add stylesheets and JavaScript to a Drupal theme or module, and I'm aware of best practices for preventing XSS and modifying the DOM. I also understand the importance of cibersecutrity and best practice to keep everything on the rigth way.
